# PicoCluster Claw Deployment Plan

## Overview

Three deployment paths, all ending at the same result: a secured PicoCluster Claw pair (claw + crush) running OpenClaw → llama-server.

---

## Part 1: Golden Image Creation

Strip down and harden base OS images. These become the PicoCluster-distributed images that ship with the product.

### 1A: RPi5 Golden Image (Raspbian)

Start with existing PicoCluster Raspbian image, then:

**Strip:**
- Remove desktop/GUI packages (if present)
- Remove LibreOffice, games, Wolfram, Sonic Pi, etc.
- Remove Bluetooth packages (no BT needed in cluster)
- Remove Avahi/mDNS (static IPs, not needed)
- Remove printing (cups)
- Remove unused locales
- Purge cached apt packages
- Clean up /tmp, logs, bash history

**Harden:**
- SSH: disable password auth, disable root login, key-only
- Firewall (ufw): deny all incoming, allow SSH (22)
- Fail2ban: protect SSH
- Unattended security updates (unattended-upgrades)
- Disable unused services (triggerhappy, bluetooth, avahi-daemon)
- Restrict /tmp (noexec mount option)
- Set file permissions: /etc/ssh/sshd_config 600
- Configure log rotation (journald max size)
- Set default user to `picocluster`
- Remove pi user if present
- Set hostname to `claw` (default, changed by configure-pair.sh)

**Pre-stage:**
- Install Node.js 24 (saves time during OpenClaw install)
- Install Docker (for containerized OpenClaw)
- Install ansible, ufw, fail2ban, unattended-upgrades
- Pre-configure NetworkManager for static IP template
- Include configure-pair.sh and ansible directory

**Output:** Minimal, hardened Raspbian image ready for `dd` capture and distribution.

**Script:** `build-rpi5-image.sh` — runs on a live RPi5, strips and hardens in place, then image with dd + jetson-shrink equivalent for Pi.

### 1B: Orin Nano Golden Image (Ubuntu/JetPack)

Start with fresh JetPack 6.x install, then:

**Strip:**
- Remove desktop/GUI packages (ubuntu-desktop, gdm3, gnome-*)
- Remove LibreOffice, Thunderbird, Firefox
- Remove unnecessary NVIDIA demo apps
- Remove Bluetooth packages
- Remove Avahi/mDNS
- Remove printing (cups)
- Purge cached apt packages
- Clean up /tmp, logs, bash history

**Harden:**
- SSH: disable password auth, disable root login, key-only
- Firewall (ufw): deny all incoming, allow SSH (22), allow port 8080 from claw IP only
- Fail2ban: protect SSH
- Unattended security updates
- Disable unused services
- Restrict /tmp
- Configure log rotation
- Set default user to `picocluster`
- Set hostname to `crush` (default, changed by configure-pair.sh)

**Pre-stage:**
- NVMe mount point (/mnt/nvme) in fstab with nofail
- CUDA/cuDNN validated (already in JetPack)
- Include configure-pair.sh
- Power mode persistence (MAXN systemd unit)

**Output:** Minimal, hardened JetPack image ready for `dd` capture → `jetson-shrink.sh` → gzip.

**Script:** `build-orin-image.sh` — runs on a live Orin Nano, strips and hardens in place.

---

## Part 2: PicoCluster Claw Software Install

Runs on golden images (or community images after Part 3 hardening). Installs and configures the full PicoCluster Claw stack.

### 2A: RPi5 (claw) — OpenClaw Install

**Script:** `install-claw.sh`

Steps:
1. Install Docker if not present
2. Pull/build OpenClaw Docker image
3. Configure OpenClaw:
   - `gateway.bind: "loopback"` (localhost only)
   - Token-based auth (auto-generate token)
   - `tools.fs.workspaceOnly: true`
   - `sandbox: "require"`
   - `plugins.allow: []` (no ClawHub skills by default)
   - `exec: "deny"` with `ask: "always"`
   - Deny control-plane tools (gateway, cron, sessions_spawn)
   - LLM endpoint → `http://crush:8080/v1` (uses /etc/hosts)
   - API key → "none" (llama-server doesn't need one)
4. Set file permissions: `chmod 600` on config, `chmod 700` on directories
5. Deploy systemd service for Docker container
6. Configure ufw:
   - Allow SSH (22)
   - Allow OpenClaw gateway (18789) from localhost only
   - Block 18791, 18792, 18800+ from all external
7. Run `openclaw security audit --fix` inside container
8. Enable and start service
9. Smoke test: health check, inference round-trip through crush

### 2B: Orin Nano (crush) — LLM Server Install

**Script:** `install-crush.sh`

Steps:
1. Mount NVMe if not mounted
2. Clone and build llama.cpp with CUDA (skip if binary exists)
3. Download default model set (~11GB)
4. Deploy llama-server systemd service
5. Configure ufw:
   - Allow SSH (22)
   - Allow port 8080 from claw IP only (not 0.0.0.0)
6. Set power mode to MAXN, persist via systemd
7. Enable and start llama-server
8. Smoke test: health check, inference test

### 2C: Pair Integration

**Script:** `configure-pair.sh` (already written)

Run on both nodes to set IPs, hostnames, /etc/hosts, and update all config files to point at each other.

**Validation script:** `validate-pair.sh`
- Ping both ways (claw ↔ crush)
- SSH both ways
- curl llama-server health from claw
- Inference round-trip from claw through crush
- Check ufw rules on both
- Check OpenClaw service health
- Check llama-server GPU memory usage
- Report pass/fail

---

## Part 3: Community Install (BYO Hardware)

For users who have their own RPi5 + Orin Nano (or similar) and their own OS images. Single script that does everything: harden + install + configure.

**Script:** `clusterclaw-setup.sh`

Usage:
```bash
# On RPi5:
curl -fsSL https://picocluster.com/clusterclaw/setup.sh | sudo bash -s claw

# On Orin Nano:
curl -fsSL https://picocluster.com/clusterclaw/setup.sh | sudo bash -s crush
```

Or download and run:
```bash
sudo ./clusterclaw-setup.sh claw --start-ip 192.168.1.50
sudo ./clusterclaw-setup.sh crush --start-ip 192.168.1.50
```

What it does:
1. Detect hardware (RPi5 vs Jetson via /proc/device-tree or nvidia-smi)
2. Detect OS (Raspbian vs Ubuntu)
3. Run hardening steps (Part 1 — strip + secure)
4. Run install steps (Part 2 — OpenClaw or llama-server)
5. Run configure-pair (set IPs, hostnames, hook them together)
6. Run validation
7. Print summary with next steps

Interactive prompts for:
- IP addressing (or accept defaults)
- Which models to download
- Whether to enable ClawHub skills (default: no)

## Phase Sequence

```
Phase 1: Image creation (you, internal)
  └── build-rpi5-image.sh
  └── build-orin-image.sh
  └── dd capture → shrink → gzip → distribute

Phase 2: Software install (runs on golden images)
  └── install-claw.sh (RPi5)
  └── install-crush.sh (Orin Nano)
  └── configure-pair.sh (both)
  └── validate-pair.sh (both)

Phase 3: Community installer (runs on any compatible hardware)
  └── clusterclaw-setup.sh (detects hardware, does everything)

Phase 4: Power draw testing
  └── Both nodes in PicoCluster Claw acrylic case

## OpenClaw Security Hardening Checklist

Applied by install-claw.sh and clusterclaw-setup.sh:

- [ ] Run in Docker container (process isolation)
- [ ] Gateway bound to loopback only (127.0.0.1)
- [ ] Token-based auth (not password)
- [ ] `tools.fs.workspaceOnly: true`
- [ ] `sandbox: "require"` for delegated agents
- [ ] `plugins.allow: []` (no ClawHub skills by default)
- [ ] `exec: "deny"`, `ask: "always"`
- [ ] Control-plane tools denied (gateway, cron, sessions_spawn)
- [ ] Config file permissions: 600 (config), 700 (directories)
- [ ] `openclaw security audit --fix` run post-install
- [ ] ufw blocks all OpenClaw ports from external access
- [ ] llama-server port 8080 restricted to claw IP only
- [ ] No plaintext API keys in config (using local llama-server, key="none")
- [ ] SSH: key-only, no root, fail2ban
- [ ] Automatic security updates enabled

## Open Questions

1. **OpenClaw Docker image** — Is there an official one, or do we build from npm inside a node:24 container?
2. **OpenClaw version pinning** — Pin to a specific version or track latest? Given security history, pinning + manual updates seems safer.
3. **Model selection UI** — Should install-crush.sh be interactive (pick models) or use a default set?
4. **Chromium in Docker** — OpenClaw runs a browser. Need to verify headless Chromium works inside the container on ARM64.
5. **Vision model** — Still TBD whether OpenClaw needs screen vision. If yes, add Moondream2 to default model set.
6. **Community script distribution** — Host on picocluster.com or GitHub releases?
